# Standardised map visualisation

## Description

The process of map production using GIS or web mapping software has become highly standardised, often with little attention paid to the quality and impact of the visual representation itself. This can lead to a lack of reflection and critical evaluation in the translation of data into visualisations. As a result, there is a growing gap in cartographic literacy.

## Application

Urban tree cadastres are usually embedded in the city's GIS, using the generic visual vocabulary provided by the programme; the design of the map elements doesn't seem to have been developed by a visual/design expert.
