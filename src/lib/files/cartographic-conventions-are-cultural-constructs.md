# Cartographic conventions are cultural constructs

## Description

Commonly used codes and symbols in maps are not based on natural laws but on established and learned conventions. For example, red as a signal colour or blue for the sea are cultural constructs rather than universal truths (Mose & Strüver). Map-making practices rely heavily on these conventions, with the aim of standardisation and unification (e.g. Bertin). While such standardisation increases clarity, it obscures the fact that map conventions are neither neutral nor truthful, but always interpretations of the (natural) world using graphic codes established by certain societies.

## Application

Tree cadastres not only neglect the growth and evolution of a tree, but also fail to represent the spatial and temporal entanglements and interactions between trees and their (built or living) environments.
