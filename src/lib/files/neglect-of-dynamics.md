# Neglect of dynamics and interdependencies in natural systems

## Description

Maps tend to abstract the temporal and spatial complexity of territorial processes, reducing ever-changing landscapes to static representations (Furlan, 2019). By isolating into static map elements, conventional map design fails to capture the dynamics and interdependencies of natural systems.

## Application

Tree cadastres not only neglect the growth and evolution of a tree, but also fail to represent the spatial and temporal entanglements and interactions between trees and their (built or living) environments.
