# Internal power of maps

## Description

The making of a map is an “inherently rhetorical” process and the key to the “internal power of maps”, described as a power inherent to cartography and coming from cartographers themselves (Harley, 1989: 12). Internal power is often subconsciously exercised and goes mostly unnoticed (Harley, 1989). In the context of biodiversity, such power imbalances can occur, for example, when individual species cannot be considered for conservation purposes because they are not visible on maps.

## Application

Tree cadastres not only neglect the growth and evolution of a tree, but also fail to represent the spatial and temporal entanglements and interactions between trees and their (built or living) environments.
