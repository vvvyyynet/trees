In light of the climate crisis, urban planning needs to take\n\t\tgreater account of their ecological functions as well as protect them from harmful effects.\n\t\tHowever, there is a lack of cartographic tools to comprehensively represent and communicate\n\t\trelevant information.</p> <p>The PhD project aims to develop cartographic visualisations that help to communicate the complex\n\t\tecological functions of trees and thereby improve knowledge transfer in urban planning. The\n\t\tproject will investigate the production processes of ecological maps as well as their reception\n\t\tand use in the field. Based on this, new forms of map visualisation will be explored and\n\t\tevaluated. The goal is to provide a research-based basis for the discussion of ecologically\n\t\tsustainable urban planning.</p> <p>This project contributes to the need for new planning principles to integrate trees into\n\t\tsustainable urban development. By providing evidence-based insights for improved information\n\t\ttransfer, it will contribute to the promotion of urban climate, quality of life and\n\t\tbiodiversity. Given the widespread use of maps to visualise the state of biodiversity, their\n\t\timpact needs to be considered holistically. As critical map and data studies have shown,\n\t\tcartographic design influences not only the perception of the natural environment but also the\n\t\tresulting conservation concepts.</p> <img class=\"mx-auto mt-24\" src=\"/images/Visualisierung_Baumoekosysteme.png\" alt=\"Visualisierung BaumÃ¶kosysteme\"></div>`;\n}\nexport {\n  _page as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"AAAA,SAAS,KAAK,CAAC,SAAS,EAAE;AAC1B,EAAE,SAAS,CAAC,GAAG,IAAI,CAAC;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,6JAA6J,CAAC;AAC9J;;;;"}
