# Isolated view of ecosystems

## Description

Traditional cartography often isolates elements of ecosystems rather than representing the interconnectedness and interdependence of species and their interactions. This focus on singular dimensions overlooks the complexity of ecosystems. A shift towards ecosystem-based thinking is essential, emphasising networks and interconnections rather than isolated components.
