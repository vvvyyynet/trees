# Neglect of visual rhetoric in scientific maps

## Description

Although visual rhetoric is an inherent part of scientific maps, it is rarely considered by scientists (Harley, 1989; Drucker, 2011). To this day, there seems to be a perception that information can be conveyed by the mere disclosure of data, and that with the advent of electronic data storage and processing, presentation has become redundant (Denil, 2003).

In maps, shape, size, color, etc. are deliberately used to direct the viewerâ€™s attention, to distinguish what is important from what is less important, and thereby to structure and hierarchize content. A landscape, or a section of it, is thus generalized, abstracted, symbolized, and hierarchized in terms of the message the map is supposed to convey, omitting everything that is not relevant to the intended message.

## Application

Tree cadastres not only neglect the growth and evolution of a tree, but also fail to represent the spatial and temporal entanglements and interactions between trees and their (built or living) environments.
