# Visualisation of invisible phenomena

## Description

The challenge is to visualise phenomena that are essentially invisible due to a lack of materiality. This includes processes and interactions such as symbioses and dependencies that are not visually manifest, as well as intangible conditions such as climatic properties (e.g. temperature, humidity or wind). Similarly, maps can reveal hidden phenomena, such as processes occurring below the Earth's surface. Visualisation can thus serve as a bridge that transforms the invisible or abstract into comprehensible, interpretable forms.
